## Attractive Image Gallery 

This is a simple and elegant image gallery web application built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It features a user-friendly interface with tabbed navigation to browse through different categories of images. The gallery utilizes a lightbox feature for viewing enlarged images along with their descriptions.

### Features

* **Tabbed Navigation:** Easily switch between different image categories (All, Birds, Nature, Flower, Animals).
* **Lightbox View:** Clicking on a thumbnail opens a full-screen overlay displaying the image in a larger size.
* **Image Descriptions:** Each image is accompanied by a short description visible in the lightbox view.
* **Previous/Next Navigation:** Navigate between images within the lightbox using the previous and next arrows.
* **Close Button:** Close the lightbox and return to the gallery view.
* **Keyboard Navigation:** Use the left and right arrow keys to navigate between images in the lightbox.
* **Double-click to Zoom:** Double-click on the image within the lightbox to zoom in and out. 

### Technologies Used

* **HTML:** Structure of the gallery, tabs, images, and lightbox.
* **CSS:** Styling for the layout, colors, fonts, animations, lightbox overlay, and responsiveness.
* **JavaScript:** Handles the tab switching, lightbox functionality (opening, closing, image display, navigation), zoom feature, and keyboard interactions.
